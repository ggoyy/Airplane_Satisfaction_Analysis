# Airplane Satisfaction Analysis
This an analysis for Airplane Satisfaction Factor. An airline company is hiring a data analyst to figure out what are their strengths, weaknesses and factors importants for passengers.

Data preparation stage includes checking missing values, filling in missing values, replacing irrational data with median because data is not normally distributed and creating average rating column.

Exploratory data analysis was done to figure out initial state of affairs. Comparing means and frequency distribution using barplot and piechart respectively. We found out that 56.7% of passengers were not satisfied, 81.7% were loyal, and 69% travelled due to business reason. This may cause loyal customers turned into disloyal.
Also, Eco class has highest number of dissatisfied passengers. This may mean our eco class are not up to standards.

I also analyzed flight lateness trend and found out 54.2% of flights were delayed with average delay duration 55.43 miinutes. Through Mann-Whitney test, we found out there are significant difference in average delay duration for satisfied and dissatisfied passengers. 

When analyzing  satisfaction factors, hypothesis testing using Chi-Square to find out that all factors are relevant towards satisfaction. Mann-Whitney test was also conducted to find out if there is any significant score difference in satisfied and dissatisfied passengers. Factors departure/arrival time convenience, gate location has no significant difference. This means the passengers received similar treatment on these factors while the rest shows different treatment.

When going in depth for each factors, our company has excellent service for inflight service and baggage handling while lowest are wifi service and ease of online booking. 

For recommendation, i suggest to develop SOP to minimize different treatment for passengers, including for departure/arrival, on-flight services. Developing online platform for tickets or connecting to travel platform is crucial to ease buying tickets online. Giving wifi as an add-on or business class only help prioritize passengers that access wifi.
